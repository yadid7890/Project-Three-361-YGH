        <h2>A short history of me</h2>
        <p> For eight years of my life, I lived in the most amazing farm ever in a house made
        completely of cement. It was the only life I knew until I moved to the third largest city
        the United States. Adjusting to living in Chicago was an exciting yet challenging process.
        Witnessing the first snowfall in my life was breath taking, but learning the language and
        culture took time. It's been a rocky road, I am proud of how far I have come and my
        accomplishments.</p>

        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p> Outside of work and school, I enjoy playing adventure games on the PS4, such as Horizon
        Zero Dawn and Detroit Become Human. I am also a big fan of the Final Fantasy game series.
        Final Fantasy XII opened my eyes to the wonders that are happening in our consoles. I don't
        know how to make video games, but I do appreciate the art! It is fantastic! I eagerly
        await to see the future of out gaming experiences. When I'm
        not playing, I also enjoy watching different TV series in my free time. Some of my favorite
        shows inclue Game of Thrones, The Man in the High Castle, Planet Earth, and Bob's Burgers. I
        also have two wonderful dogs that I enjoy taking care of. Their names are Bonbon and
        Oliver-- they are both Australian Cattle Dogs. They are both incredily playful and friendly.</p>
